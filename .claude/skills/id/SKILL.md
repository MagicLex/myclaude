Refresh context with the essentials. Read and briefly acknowledge:

1. **Identity** — Read CLAUDE.md, re-state who you are in one sentence
2. **Principles** — List the key hierarchy (KISS > LoB > DRY > SOLID) and the code club rules
3. **Project structure** — Run a quick scan of the project tree and summarize what's where
4. **Active docs** — List any documentation files present and their purpose

Keep the output short and structured. This is a context reset, not an essay.
